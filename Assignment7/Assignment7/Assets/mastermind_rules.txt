Mastermind - HOW TO PLAY

Your mission is to guess the correct row of colors, which is hidden behind the black label. On each guess you will get information about:

1. Number of right colors in the right place (black)
2. Number of right colors in the wrong place (white)
3. Wrong color (crossed)

You have 10 guesses to get it right!

Game modes:

Easy (NOT IMPLEMENTED YET):
The result will tell you which guess that is correct, so you will know which of the colors that is correct and in the right place etc.

Medium:
Choose one of 6 colors to find the correct sequence. Each color is only used once. The result will not show which position that is correct.

Hard (NOT IMPLEMENTED YET):
Colors can exist more than once in the correct row.
